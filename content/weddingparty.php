            <p>When it came time to select a best man and master of ceremonies for our wedding day there wasn't another person that came to mind. Manny and I met in grade 8 and quickly bonded over bagged crab and cans of coke on his front porch. Our love for music and delectable treats kick started a bond that would last a life time. Wether it be helping me with homework, planning an awesome party or just needing someone to bounce a stupid idea off, Manny has always been there - all judgements aside. It's not often a couple can say they share a best friend, but we're truly honoured to do exactly that. We couldn't imagine having anyone else stand by our sides on the most important day of our lives.</p>

            <p>Preeti and I met in Grade 1 and we have been there for each other ever since. Food, shopping and boys basically sums up our relationship then and now.  From hosting our own “food fests” in high school (held in my bed) to now planning a wedding together 22 years later!  The relationship I have with Preeti is the kind where we can be put in any situation and still have an amazing time with one another no matter what the circumstances (even clubbing in crocs).  I really missed my best friend while she lived in Vancouver for 4 years but she moved back home last fall and we picked up exactly where we left off.  Preeti has the kindest heart imaginable. If there is anyone I strive to be more like its Preeti; kind, thoughtful, generous, and selfless.  When it came to choosing a Maid of Honour I knew exactly who to turn to.  Adam and I are so lucky to have Preeti standing up for us on our wedding day.</p>

        	<p>Ryan is my amazingly brilliant nephew whom Adam and I love dearly.  I’ve never met such a naturally intelligent child.  You can never be upset when Ryan is around, instead your jaw will hurt from laughing at his adorable jokes.  Ryan is already obsessed with going to the racetrack and helping his daddy work on his car.  Ryan also loves playing video games with Uncy Addy, hide and go seek with Jersey, and having his Auntie play whatever he requests! Adam and I are truly overjoyed to have Ryan so involved on our special day.  He may just be the best looking male in a suit!</p>

        <p>Nicole and I were lucky enough to live around the corner from one another when growing up.  We really started to become good friends in Grade 8.  We were partners in crime in high school, finding trouble and helping one another get out of it as bff’s do!  Nicole is the kind of girl who will take too much on in order to help others out.  With Nicole’s busy work schedule it was always a challenge to catch up with her.  Now I have the honour of saying we are roomies and we get to catch up with one another all the time! Adam and I are so very thankful to have Nicole so close to us and involved in our day to day lives.  We are honoured to have her playing such a special role in our wedding.</p>

            <p>Lindsay and I met in Grade 1 and share all sorts of memories together.  Sleepovers, birthday parties, and volunteering at the Humane Society.  When we were young we shared a common interest of careers to pursue when we grew up which included becoming an actress, model, or marine biologist; all of which we are still working on of course! From running to rollerblading and giving each other advice we have always been there for one another.  Something that I truly admire about Lindsay is her love of travelling and how nothing ever holds her back.  Although she spends a lot of time outside of Ontario it seems that no matter how many kilometres we have between us we are still always there for one another and our friendship remains strong.  Lindsay is a free spirited, adventurous, amazing friend.  My life would be lacking a lot of stories without her.  Adam and I are so excited to have her by our sides on our big day.</p>

            <p>It’s not often in life you get the opportunity to develop such a strong, meaningful friendship as adults.  Hilary and I met 3 years ago in Teacher’s College at UOIT and I will always be thankful for that.  Our friendship is what got us through that year of school; it kept us laughing if nothing else (banana phone)!  Ever since we met, Hilary and I have shared several whine/wine and cheese sessions.  She is a kind, creative, and talented individual who always pulls through when it matters most.  We are excited for Hilary to stand with us during our milestone and even more excited to stand beside her while welcoming Baby Zareian into the world!</p>

            <p>My friendship with Melissa blossomed about 10 years ago.  Her husband Ryan and Adam were best buds and I inevitably got to know Melissa because of it.  I couldn’t have been luckier to be led to such an amazing girl.  We have shared many memories together including Blue Mountain trips nearly every year since we met, our famous and impressive choreographed dance competitions, and of course amazing conversations.  I often refer to Melissa as a mini Martha Stewart.  She can balance nearly anything that is thrown at her in the calmest of ways.  Because of this Melissa is such an inspiration.  She has proven that you really can be a mini Martha even with a beautiful newborn baby boy.  Adam and I are thrilled to have our amazing friend sharing in the memories of our wedding day.</p>

            <p>Kristen is like the sister I never had! It is not often your sister in law doubles as a good friend!  Kristen has one of the biggest hearts and will always be there to back up Adam or myself as we would for her.  She has an amazing energetic personality and is talented in so many ways.  I truly admire Kristen’s talent in the kitchen. I love being able to have a master chef to call when I have cooking questions (I’m sure Adam benefits from this as well).  Adam and I are delighted to have his sister’s support on our big day.</p>

            <p>Chris was the new kid at school. He had spikey-hair and wore nothing but band t-shirts, so inevitably we'd instantly become the best of pals. We collectively used more Dippity-Do hair gel then any guido on the Jersey Shore to date. We played in all the school bands by day, and formed our own punk bands at night. Music was, and still is a huge part of our friendship. You'll often find us talking about this new awesome band we've found or arguing about how great/terrible Green Day really is. Any time I'm bummed, bored, or just looking to hang with a friend, Chris is always ready to roll - no questions asked. He might be a small guy, but without a doubt has one of the biggest hearts I know and I'm honoured to have Chris stand beside me on this day!</p>

        	<p>I consider Paul my little italian brother. I'm not sure if it's the fact that I tower over him, but I've always felt more of a protective/brotherly bond with him. We grew up playing hockey and music together. We'd often try to swoon the ladies by recording awful harmonies on a tape recorder in my dining room. When we weren't playing music we'd be skateboarding with the gang at CE Broughton Public School. I've always admired Paul for how naturally his talents seem to come to him. I was heart broken when he and his family moved out to Stoufville after high school, but it's easy to make an amazing friendship work and that's why we're still the best of friends to this day.</p>

        	<p>Believe it or not, Payam and I have only known each other for just over 3 years now. In this short period of time, I've definitely learned that you cannot define a friendship merely by the length of time you've known someone, but it is the connection with that person that truly matters. I'd honestly believe that we were brothers separated at birth, if it wasn't for our contradicting skin tones. 
Payam and I share a passion for entrepreneurialism and all things technology, but really love nothing more than being on the water on a hot summers day. It's not often that you can meet a best friend at this stage of your life, but now I couldn't imagine how life would be without him. </p>

        	<p>My first concrete memory of Shane is in grade 10, where we shared the same co-op class. It was quiz day and Shane had a massive nose bleed all over his test. We both laughed it off and I think became best buds from there on out. Shane has this adventurous side to him which I've always admired. Wether it be riding dirt bikes, or moving out west to snowboard, he was always doing something I only wished I'd had the guts to do. When Tara and I purchased our first home 2 years ago we were lucky enough to have our best pal move in with us. We'll forever miss his contagious laugh and BBQ's in the backyard, but we're so proud to see him moving on to bigger and brighter things! We're both truly honoured to have Shane be a part of our wedding day. </p>

        	<p>Ryan grew up right across the street from Manny, and it was in that neighbourhood that we spent every waking moment come sumer time (if not loitering at Jug City). Like our other friends, Ryan was heavy into music and guitar, but he also had a keen interest in cars - which I always found fascinating. He was always tinkering with something and was amazing with his hands, which was always the exact opposite of myself. Although we grew up with the same friends at the same pace, he was always the first one to plunge into responsibility while the rest of us waited for him to test the waters - from owning cars, buying a house, getting married and now recently having his first son. He's in many ways carved out the path for a lot of events in my life and I will forever respect and admire him for that. We couldn't be happier to have him stand beside us on such a special day.</p>
