<p>The couple was introduced back in 2001 while out for dinner with a group of friends at Melanie Pringles. They instantly hit it off and became great friends. They both loved to laugh and socialize so it was an instant connection. Tara also had her license and a luxurious Dodge Dynasty from the 80's which made her the complete package. The second Tara met Adam she knew that this was the guy for her, funny, handsome, and modest – what more could she ask for? Adam of course felt the same, but always liked to play a good game of hardball. After being just buds for quite a few months, Tara began to think Adam was not interested in her and was about to move on until a friend spilled the beans! Adam had said she was beautiful and that he was maybe interested in going on a date! Tara was ecstatic to hear this news.  The soon to be couple started hanging out more and more and before you knew it, sparks began to fly. When he finally gathered the courage, Adam invited Tara over to his parent’s house one evening where he presented her with a freshly picked flower and officially asked Tara to be his girlfriend. The rest… is history!</p>

<p>It is hard to imagine that this little teenage story has led to the wonderful life they lead together now. A beautiful house, a handsome dog and now the perfect wedding! The happy couple has such a great history with great supportive families, friends who will always be there for them, and of course each other.  They are very excited for everyone to help them write the next chapter of this fairytale on September 7, 2012.</p>
